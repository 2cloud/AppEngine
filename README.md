## 2cloud App Engine Server

### About

2cloud is a free, decentralised, open source project to try and make sharing 
content between browsers and devices as seamless and effortless as possible. An 
up-to-date list of devices and browsers supported by the project is available at 
http://www.2cloudproject.com/clients

This is the App Engine software that powers our public server at 
https://2cloudapp.appspot.com. We provide it here as a reference for implementing 
your own server software for the project and as a plug and play package for users 
who want to host their own servers, but don't necessarily want to write their own 
server.

### Installation Instructions

Installation is as simple as getting an App Engine account and following Google's 
instructions. We'll have a more detailed guide here soon.

### Where to Get Help

We try to maintain a presence with our users. To wit, we have:

* A Tender support site (the best way to get help with "it's not working"): http://help.2cloudproject.com
* An announcement mailing list (the best way to stay up-to-date on downtime and changes): http://groups.google.com/group/2cloud-announce
* A discussion mailing list (the best way to talk to other users and the team): http://groups.google.com/group/2cloud
* A development mailing list (the best way to stay on top of API changes): http://groups.google.com/groups/2cloud-dev
* A beta mailing list (if you want to help test buggy software): http://groups.google.com/group/2cloud-beta
* A Twitter account (the best way to stay on top of new releases and other updates): http://www.twitter.com/2cloudproject
* A Facebook page (the second best way to stay on top of new releases and other updates): http://www.facebook.com/2cloud
* A website (for a bunch of other links and information): http://www.2cloudproject.com
* A blog (for lengthier updates and explanations): http://blog.2cloudproject.com
* A Github account (where all our source code and issues reside): https://www.github.com/2cloud

If you don't use _any_ of those... you're kind of out of luck.

### Contributors

2cloud is an open source application. It is technically "owned" by [Second Bit LLC](http://www.secondbit.org), 
but all that really means is they take care of the mundane administrative and 
financial stuff. The team behind 2cloud is separate from the Second Bit team 
(despite some overlap). The 2cloud team is as follows:

* Paddy Foran - Lead Developer - [@paddyforan](http://www.twitter.com/paddyforan) - http://www.paddyforan.com/
* Dylan Staley - UI/UX Lead - [@dstaley](http://www.twitter.com/dstaley) - http://www.dstaley.me
* Tino Galizio - Project Manager - [@tinogalizio](http://www.twitter.com/tinogalizio) - http://www.secondbit.org/team/tino

They're pretty friendly. Please do get in touch!

Who inspired this? What Open Source stuff are you using? Who can I use when I realise your code sucks?
